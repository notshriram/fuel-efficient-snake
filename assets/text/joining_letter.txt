Dear Mr. Snake,
Welcome aboard the Hiss Hiss Hurray Shipping Corp.! Here at Hiss Hiss Hurray, We are not just a company, we are a family. We are a family of snakes.

You will be working with us as a Delivery Snake. Your job is to collect packages so that they are delivered to our customers.

You will earn a daily salary, and you will be paid 500 rattlecoin at the end of each day.

Since there are no labour laws in the snake world, you will be working 24/7 until you die. We will provide you with a nice, warm, and cozy home, so you don't have to worry about that.
We will also provide you with a nice, warm, and cozy coffin, so you don't have to worry about that either.

Petrol prices are very high in the snake world, so you will lose 1 rattlecoin for every unnecessary step you take from the shortest path to your destination.

You are a Delivery Snake, not a Delivery Snake with a Side of Fries. You are not allowed to eat any of the packages you deliver.
and finally, you are not allowed to eat any of the customers you deliver to.

Always remember: Here at Hiss Hiss Hurray Shipping Co., you are not just a serpent, you are also a servant.
